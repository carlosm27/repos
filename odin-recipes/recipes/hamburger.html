      <h4>This is a great hamburger for the grill.
        Feta cheese gives it a rich and creamy taste..</h4>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
          <li>Â½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
          <li>Knead together the ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt,
             and pepper in a bowl. Form the mixture into 8 equal-sized balls;
             flatten to make thin patties. Place about 1/4 cup of feta cheese
             onto each of four of the patties. Top each of the patties with
             cheese with one of the patties without; press the edges together
             to seal the cheese into the center.</li>
          <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the burgers are cooked to
            your desired degree of doneness, 7 to 8 minutes per side for well
            done. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
            read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
